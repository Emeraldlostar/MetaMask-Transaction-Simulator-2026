MetaMask Transaction Simulator is a powerful security tool designed to protect users from risky and malicious blockchain transactions. By simulating transactions before they are signed and sent, this feature allows users to clearly see the potential outcomes, including token transfers, balance changes, and permission approvals. It helps identify hidden threats such as wallet drainers, phishing smart contracts, and excessive token approvals.

Built directly into MetaMask, one of the most popular Web3 wallets, the Transaction Simulator enhances on-chain security and user confidence. It provides transparency by previewing how a smart contract will interact with your assets, reducing the risk of fraud and costly mistakes. This makes it especially valuable for DeFi users, NFT traders, and anyone interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).
